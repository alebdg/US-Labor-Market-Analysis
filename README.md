# US-Labor-Market-Analysis

DESCRIPTION
This very brief projects aimed at an analysis of the US Labor Market based on a comparison of Unemployment Rate and Participation rate.
In the repository there are two documents, the first is a copy of the python code I wrote on Jupyter Notebook and the second one a short description of how the two rates are calculated, why are they important and what conclusion we get from comparing the two.

I used the FRED API to get all datas and matplotlib, pandas and numpy to clean, analyse and plot.
